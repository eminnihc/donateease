          Book Donation in India is an extremely important issue because of the
          following reasons:

          <ListGroup.Item as="li">
            <b>Low literacy rate:</b> India has a literacy rate of 77.7% as of
            2021, which is lower than the global average of 86.3%. This means
            that a significant proportion of the Indian population does not have
            access to books or the ability to read them.
          </ListGroup.Item>
          <ListGroup.Item as="li">
            <b>Unequal distribution of books:</b> Even among the literate
            population, there is an unequal distribution of books. According to
            a 2019 study by the National Council of Educational Research and
            Training (NCERT), only 12% of Indian children have access to a
            library at their school. This means that the majority of children
            have to rely on their families or other sources to get books.
          </ListGroup.Item>
          <ListGroup.Item as="li">
            <b>High cost of books:</b> Books can be expensive, especially for
            low-income families. According to a 2020 study by the National Book
            Trust, the average price of a book in India is â‚¹200. This may seem
            like a small amount, but for many families, it is a significant
            expense.
